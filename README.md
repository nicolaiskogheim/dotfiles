# My dotfiles

These are all my configuration files which I use on OSX and Arch Linux.

There isn't much documentatin in the files, but if you have a question/suggestion
please don't hesitate to let me know.

## WARNING
Copying my Vim config doesn't make your Vim awesome.
Copying my bashrc or zshrc won't make your shell awesome.

I have put some effort in creating an environment that works for me,
but that doesn't mean it's the right thing for you. I even have some
strange preferences, like moving window focus left/right with s/f, 
and not h/l as most people do.
